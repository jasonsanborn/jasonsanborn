This is the personal GitHub repository for @jasonsanborn.  I am primarily a C# developer and Microsfoft Dynamics CE Technical Architect. I've been coding since BASIC on the Commodore-64. From there, I went onto BASIC on the Apple II systems. When the Internet started to gain popularity, I started working with HTML and JavaScript. That evolved into XHTML, CSS and even ASP with VisualBasic 6.0 COM components. I migrated from VB6 to ASP.NET using VB.NET with version 1 of the .NET Framework. By the time version 3 of the .NET Framework was released, I switched over to coding in C#. As such, I've been programming C# since around 2007, so it is no surprise that it is my preferred programming language. JavaScript has been another area I've worked with for probably closer to 30 years, but I never really delved into any of the frameworks much. I'm familiar with HTML5 and CSS3, but I am far from a UI expert, working mostly on backend functionality. I've been working with Microsoft Dynamics CE since it was Microsoft CRM 3.0. I am Microsoft Certified, and have worked on every version. online or on premise, since around 2009. I've dabbled with PHP, making plugins and themes for phpBB and Wordpress, but am by no means an expert there.

Included in GitHub will be code samples and personal projects. I'm not sure exactly what will be included yet, but the idea is to share my knowledge and experience which will include code samples. It will also contain projects where I might be learning something new. Whatever I put here, please make sure you abide by whatever license is included for the project. Thank you for visiting.

**My Skills**

- ASP.NET: ⭐⭐ Yes, I have experience here, but am so out of touch with it. I can read it and work with it, but it's changed a lot since I used it last.  
- C#: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mostly coding in .NET 6.0. This is my go-to and strongest coding experience.  
- HTML: ⭐⭐ I used to do web design starting with HTML 2.0 and stopped when XHTML 1.1 was still new. I still do some web work with HTML 5, but it really isn't a forte.  
- JavaScript: ⭐⭐⭐ I've worked with JS since working with HTML, and have never gotten away from it. Haven't worked much with web/JavaScript frameworks.  
- Microsoft Azure: ⭐ Azure Functions and Azure WebAPIs I do have some experience with. I am Microsoft certified in the basics of Azure.  
- Microsoft Dynamics CE: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ I am Microsoft Certified and work almost exclusively in CE: Customizations, Configurations, Plugins (C#), Workflows, Web Resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
- Microsoft Power Platform: ⭐⭐ CE is moving more toward Power Platform and Power Apps. I can create Flows and Model Driven Apps. I have limited familiarity with Canvas Apps as well.  
- PHP: ⭐⭐ I used to modify WordPress and PHPBB. I can still work with it, but I prefer to let others handle it where possible.  
- SQL: ⭐⭐⭐ I have worked with MS-SQL, MySql (MariaDB) and SQLite. I've built and edited tables, views and stored procedures. I've connected to SQL mostly with C#, but with PHP as well.  
- VB.NET: ⭐⭐ Haven't worked with this in years, preferring C#, but this is where I started with ASP.NET 1.0.  

**Stars**

⭐ - *Initiate* - Just starting to look at this. Very superficial knowledge. Google is my friend.  
⭐⭐ - *Novice* - I know enough to get around and do what needs to get done. Much Google-Fu is still required.  
⭐⭐⭐ - *Experienced* - The Force is strong in this one but some training still is required. Google is used to fill in gaps.  
⭐⭐⭐⭐ - *Expert* - I know a lot about this and can perform even more complex tasks. More innate knowledge, less Google.  
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - *Master* - I know it all and keep up with all the changes to continue to know it all. Google comes to me for the information. Of course, I have nothing in this category, nor do I see myself ever having anything in this category. I do strive for it, though.
